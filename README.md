# 20 11 24 JS Intro Primary
Completed exercises sets 1 and 2. Each set must be completed in order since each exercise will build on it's self. Add comments above each exercise solution (at minimum). When grading this assignment I will only run code that is not commented out. If you have partially functioning code comment it out and provide some context of what wasn't working so I can provide feedback.
